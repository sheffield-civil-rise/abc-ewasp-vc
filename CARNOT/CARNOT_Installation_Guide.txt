Installation of the CARNOT Blockset on a Windows 64 bit computer 
**********************************************************************

1.  Download the Carnot zip file. 

2.  Extract the contents of the zip file to [Path_to_Carnot], where 
    [Path_to_Carnot] can be any directory.

3.  Run the file "init_carnot.m" from the [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b
    folder to automatically add folders to the Matlab path. 
    If you prefer to add Carnot permanently to the path, run the file “init_carnot_savepath.m”.

OR  Manually add the following folders to the Matlab path:
    (Menu "File" -> "Set Path", Save when finished)

        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\internal\bin
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\public\bin
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\internal
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\internal\src_m
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\public\src_m
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\internal\data
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\public\data
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\internal\src
        [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\public\src

    and click "Update Toolbox Path Cache" from Menu "File" -> "Preferences" -> "General" 
    OR type "rehash toolboxcache;" in the command window 

4.  Carnot is installed and ready to run
    type "carnot" in the command window to open it. 

5. Type "helpcarnot" to access the CARNOT documentation. 
   Further information can be found in the subfolders of carnot_62_2016b\public\tutorial\

NOTE :  The included S-functions have been compiled with MinGW64 compiler installed in Matlab R2016b. If you change something in the C-file or expand the library with an other compiler problems may arise.

===========================================================================
Installation of the CARNOT Blockset on other systems 
****************************************************

1.  Perform steps 1.-3. above

2.  Run "mex -setup" from the command window to setup your compiler.

3.  Move to the [Path_to_Carnot]\carnot_62_2016b\version_manager directory
    and run "MakeMEX.m". This will automatically compile and link all
    included S-functions with your selected compiler.

4.  Click "Update Toolbox Path Cache" from Menu "File" -> "Preferences" -> "General" 
    OR type "rehash toolboxcache;" in the command window 

5.  Carnot is installed and ready to run, type "carnot" in the command window to open it.
